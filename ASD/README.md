- And buildEditMenu also contains some similar code to buildFileMenu , so I used the same function(optionMenu) 

- In actionPerformed there are conditional sentences if and else, so I deleted the else and converted it to if if necessary.

- The comparison statement inside the if you declare it inside a variable of type boolean

- In actionPerformed code has been repeated twice in the code, so I made a new function(saveFile) for him

- In loadFile there are conditional sentences if and else, so I deleted the else and converted it to if if necessary.

- The comparison statement inside the if you declare it inside a variable of type boolean

- In loadFile there is code, it has been repeated twice, but it is similar to the new function(saveFile) that I created, so I called it

- In loadFile I made a new function(readFile) of a part of the code

- There is a question and a comment that contains a part of the code that is not used, as well as a definition of the parameter that is not used
